# 1. NYC Bike Trip Spatio-Temporal Analysis (QGIS/PostGIS Focused)

This repository documents the analysis of spatio-temporal patterns in New York City bike trip data using QGIS, PostGIS, and SQL. The analysis focuses on leveraging the QGIS DB Manager plugin to run PostGIS queries and visualize the results directly within QGIS.

## Project Overview

This project aims to:

* Import and manage NYC bike trip data in a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database.
* Perform spatial and temporal analysis using SQL queries within the QGIS DB Manager.
* Visualize the analysis results directly in QGIS, highlighting spatio-temporal patterns.
* Create informative visualizations using Python based on the SQL query outputs.

## Data

The data used in this project is [mention the source of the data, e.g., NYC Open Data]. A dummy/sample dataset `data/raw/nyc_bike_trips.csv` is provided for testing purposes.

## Tools and Technologies

* **QGIS:** Open-source Geographic Information System for visualization and database management.
* **PostGIS:** Spatial database extension for PostgreSQL, used within QGIS DB Manager.
* **PostgreSQL:** Database used to store and query spatial data.
* **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib):** For additional data visualization based on SQL query results.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/NYC_BikeTrip_SpatioTemporalAnalysis.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/yourusername/NYC_BikeTrip_SpatioTemporalAnalysis.git)
    cd NYC_BikeTrip_SpatioTemporalAnalysis
    ```

2.  **Install PostgreSQL and PostGIS:**

    * Install PostgreSQL and PostGIS.
    * Create a database (e.g., `nyc_bike_trips`) and enable the PostGIS extension:

        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE nyc_bike_trips;
        \c nyc_bike_trips;
        CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
        ```

3.  **Install QGIS:**

    * Install QGIS. Make sure PostGIS is enabled in your PostgreSQL connection within QGIS.

4.  **Load Data into PostGIS using QGIS DB Manager:**

    * Open QGIS and connect to your PostgreSQL database.
    * Use the DB Manager plugin to import the `data/raw/nyc_bike_trips.csv` data into a PostGIS table.

5.  **Run SQL Queries in QGIS DB Manager:**

    * Copy and paste the SQL queries from `qgis_project/postgis_queries.sql` into the QGIS DB Manager query window.
    * Execute the queries and save the results as a CSV file (`data/processed/analysis_results.csv`).

6.  **Open QGIS Project:**

    * Open `qgis_project/nyc_bike_trips.qgs` in QGIS.
    * Add the `analysis_results.csv` as a layer to visualize the results.

7.  **Run Python Visualization Script (Optional):**

    * Create a virtual environment:

        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
        venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
        ```

    * Install dependencies:

        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

    * Run the Python script:

        ```bash
        python scripts/visualization.py
        ```

# 2. requirements.txt (Minimal Python Dependencies)
pandas
matplotlib

# 3. data/processed/analysis_results.csv (CSV Output)
This file will contain the results of your SQL queries executed in QGIS DB Manager.
Ensure the CSV has columns suitable for visualization (e.g., time intervals, counts, geometries).

# 4. qgis_project/postgis_queries.sql (SQL Queries)
-- Example queries (adjust to your actual analysis and explain each query regarding the problem)

# 5. qgis_project/nyc_bike_trips.qgs (QGIS Project)
Import the PostGIS table and the analysis_results.csv into the QGIS project.
Style the layers to visualize the spatio-temporal patterns (e.g., heatmaps, graduated symbols, time series plots).
Use the DB Manager to connect to the PostGIS database.
Save the QGIS project.

# 6. scripts/visualization.py (Python Visualization)
This will include python script and explanation on the result

# 7. docs/report.md (Detailed Report)
- Focus on the QGIS/PostGIS workflow.
- Show screenshots of your QGIS project and DB Manager queries.
- Explain the SQL queries and their purpose.
- Describe the visualization process in QGIS.
- Explain the python visualisations and why they were created.

## Usage

* **`qgis_project/postgis_queries.sql`:** Contains the SQL queries used to analyze the bike trip data within QGIS DB Manager.
* **`qgis_project/nyc_bike_trips.qgs`:** The QGIS project file, pre-configured to visualize the analysis results.
* **`scripts/visualization.py`:** Python script for generating additional visualizations based on the `analysis_results.csv` file.
* **QGIS DB Manager:** Use the DB Manager plugin to run the SQL queries and manage your PostGIS data.
